# AI Data Analyst

This web application allows you to upload a CSV file and interact with an AI agent powered by Google's Gemini Pro model to analyze and visualize your data.

## Features

-   **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions about your data in Natural Language.
-   **Data Visualization**: Generate plots and charts on the fly.
-   **Powered by Gemini Pro**: Leverages Google's state-of-the-art language model for insightful analysis.
-   **Secure**: Your API key is stored securely in a `.env` file.
-   **Modular Architecture**: The code is organized into logical modules for better maintainability.

## How it Works

The application functions as follows:
1.  **Data Upload:** Users upload a CSV file through the Streamlit web interface.
2.  **Agent Initialization:** The `app.py` script initializes the LangChain agent, utilizing `agent_handler.py` to configure the agent with Google's Gemini Pro model.
3.  **Natural Language Querying:** Users can ask questions about their data in plain English.
4.  **Data Analysis & Visualization:** The AI agent processes these queries, performs analysis, and generates visualizations (charts, plots) using components defined in `ui_components.py`.
5.  **Output Display:** The results of the analysis and visualizations are presented back to the user within the Streamlit application.
